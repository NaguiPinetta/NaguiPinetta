# NaguiPinetta (Jonathan Pinetta)

Technical Writer • UX Writer • Systems Architect  
I build AI-powered documentation, knowledge platforms, and automation tools — especially for complex products in logistics, SaaS, and enterprise workflows.

## What I’m focused on
- **Knowledge base intelligence** (RAG, chunking/embeddings, structured export)
- **Doc systems at scale** (standards, templates, IA, governance)
- **Localization & terminology systems** (glossaries, TMS workflows, microcopy quality)
- **Builder mindset**: turning documentation pain into productized tools

## Flagship work
### Eurekapp — AI-Powered Knowledge Base Intelligence & Automation
End-to-end system that scans and reconstructs large Aha! Knowledge Bases, builds a RAG pipeline (pgvector), enables a grounded Copilot, and automates work requests/comments back into Aha.  
→ Case study: **(add your portfolio link here later)**

### Omniglot — Translation / Localization Wrapper + Job Pipeline
A practical platform for batch translation of UI microcopy and documentation using model selection, glossaries/style rules, and structured jobs.  
→ Case study: **(add your portfolio link here later)**

### AI Tunes — Local Fine-Tuning & Evaluation Lab
Tooling for dataset creation, training adapters (LoRA), and evaluation workflows for local models — built to test behavior, consistency, and automation scenarios.  
→ Case study: **(add your portfolio link here later)**

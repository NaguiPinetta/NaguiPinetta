## What I’m focused on

- Knowledge base intelligence (RAG, chunking/embeddings, structured export)
- Documentation systems at scale (standards, templates, IA, governance)
- Localization & terminology systems (glossaries, TMS workflows, microcopy quality)
- Builder mindset: turning documentation pain into productized tools

## Flagship Work

### **Eurekapp > AI-Powered Knowledge Base Intelligence & Automation**
End-to-end system that scans and reconstructs large Aha! Knowledge Bases, builds a RAG pipeline (pgvector), enables a grounded Copilot, and automates work requests and inline comments back into Aha.

→ Case study: *(coming soon)*

---

### **Omniglot > Translation / Localization Wrapper + Job Pipeline**
Platform for batch translation of UI microcopy and documentation using model selection, glossaries, style rules, and structured jobs.

→ Case study: *(coming soon)*

---

### **AI Tunes > Local Fine-Tuning & Evaluation Lab**
Tooling for dataset creation, adapter training (LoRA), and evaluation workflows for local models > designed to test behavior, consistency, and automation scenarios.

→ Case study: *(coming soon)*
